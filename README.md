# Electronic Program Guide (EPG) Downloader

A media player like [KODI](https://kodi.tv) can use Electronic Program Guide
(EPG) to provide a guide when watching TV channel. There is an utility to
download those EPG available at https://github.com/iptv-org/epg. This Docker
Compose can be used to automate those task.

This docker compose created with concept of `plug and forget`, once the configuration
is satisfied, start docker compose then forget it. The guide will always be built
based on latest fix available on EPG site.

## Features

* Automatically sync repository on every EPG build

* Your local changes to repository is stashed on EPG build and then re-applied

* Configurable languages, sites, and max connections

* Schedule EPG build as you need using CRON

* Curated channels

* On demand EPG build

## Usage

The steps is described as follows:

* Clone this repository.

  ```sh
  cd ~
  git clone https://github.com/tohenk/docker-epg
  cd docker-epg
  ```

* Adjust `.env` as you need, you can change the web server port, customize NGINX guides
  path, provide your time zone, choose the [Debian mirror](https://www.debian.org/mirror/list)
  to close as possible to your location, and choose which Node major version to use.

  ```sh
  vi .env
  ```

  ```
  APP_NAME=epg
  APP_HTTP_PORT=80
  APP_GUIDES_DIR=guides
  APP_TIMEZONE=Asia/Jakarta
  APT_MIRROR=kartolo.sby.datautama.net.id
  NODE_VERSION=22
  ```

* Includes which sites and language to build, see https://github.com/iptv-org/epg/blob/master/SITES.md.
  If you include curated channels, adjust the days for those channels to fetch.

  ```sh
  vi config/guides.env
  ```

  ```sh
  LANGS="id"
  SITES="firstmedia.com indihometv.com mncvision.id vidio.com visionplus.id"
  CURATED_DAYS="2"
  ```

  The number of connections for fetching the site can be specified by appending the
  number delimited by `:`, e.g. `mncvision.id:5` will use max connections of 5.

* A curated channels can be provided if necessary.

  ```sh
  vi config/channels.xml
  ```

  ```xml
  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
  <channels>
    <channel site="cubmu.com" lang="id" xmltv_id="BioskopIndonesia.id" site_id="4028c68574537fcd0174be26e4325724">Bioskop Indonesia</channel>
  </channels>
  ```

  More curated channels is supported, just drop the filename as `[alias].channels.xml`.
  The `[alias]` would be any name of your choice, e.g. `my-fav-guide.channels.xml`.

* If necessary, you can customize CRON job. By default it will build EPG once, then every 00:00.

  ```sh
  vi cron/crontab.prod
  ```

  ```
  * * * * * /cron/epg.sh auto 2>&1 | tee -a ~/epg.log
  0 0 * * * /cron/epg.sh 2>&1 | tee -a ~/epg.log
  ```

* Start the container, if you need to view the console output use `docker logs`.

  ```sh
  sudo docker compose up -d
  sudo docker logs -f epg-cron
  ```

  ```

* A build log for each site can be viewed by `exec`-ing into container.

  ```sh
  sudo docker exec -it epg-cron /bin/bash
  su epg

  ```
  epg.log  firstmedia.com.log  indihometv.com.log  mncvision.id.log  vidio.com.log  visionplus.id.log

* To build EPG on demand, create an empty `.run` file in `build` folder.

  ```sh
  touch ./build/.run
  ```
